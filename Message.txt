check out Pokeapi, we can use some of the json files for examples.
ill add a json file with the first 9 pokemon in it.

also this seems interesting but its in kotlin 
https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokekotlin
it still works for java actually, can you try to figure out how to install it? i think we should start fresh in regards to "pokemon" and use this tool to make it easier.
